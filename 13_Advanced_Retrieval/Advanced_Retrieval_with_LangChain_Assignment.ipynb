John initially refuses, leading Santino to blow up his house. John is compelled to kill Santino's sister, Gianna D'Antonio, in Rome so that Santino can take a seat on the High Table of the criminal organizations. After completing the task, Santino betrays John by putting a $7 million contract on his head, forcing John to fight against numerous professional killers while vowing to kill Santino, who is no longer protected by his marker.\\n\\nOverall, John Wick is a story about a legendary hitman pulled back into a deadly underworld by personal loss, loyalty, and betrayal, leading to relentless action and a quest for vengeance.\""
